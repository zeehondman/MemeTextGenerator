Meme Text Generator

This is a standalone executable that generates a random version of the sentence entered by the user. The script uses the pyautogui module to simulate keyboard input and tkinter to create a GUI window.
Usage

To use the executable, simply double-click the MemeTextGenerator.exe file. Note that you may get a warning that the file is from an unknown publisher and may be unsafe. This is because the executable is not signed with a digital certificate.

To proceed with running the executable, you can click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to launch the program.
